# diy electric longboard!

### my first diy vehicle
So, I want to make a completely DIY electric longboard! It will have a powerful 12S2P Li-ion battery pack with a capable AliExpress BMS, paired with a reliable Flipsky VESC controller and a matching brand BLDC motor. I had to make it this powerful and capable because I want to use it to travel 15 km to school, and there are some not-so-small hills on the way that need good torque, plus it'll be great for weekend travels to nearby shop or to meet my friends.

Feel free to edit, mix or do anything you want with my project – I love the open source community! You can use my project to convert your longboard to an electric one, or as a base for your own electric conversion project!
